# Twenty

Welcome to Twenty documentation!

## High Level Overview

Twenty development stack is composed of 3 different layers

- front: our frontend React app
- hasura: our graphql engine exposing our database and server
- server: our backend that contain endpoint, crm logic, scripts, jobs...
- storages: postgres

## Setup env variables and npmrc variables

`cp ./infra/dev/.env.example ./infra/dev/.env` and fill with values

## Development environment setup with docker-compose (Recommended)

We also provide a containerized environment with Docker and orchestrated with docker-compose in case it is easier for you. This install will also provision a postgres container out of the box.

### Step 1: pre-requesites

Make sure to have the latest Docker and Docker-compose versions installed on your computer. You can run `docker-compose --version` to check if you have docker-compose installed and `docker --version` to check if you have docker installed.

### Step 2: docker build

Build docker containers.

The whole setup experience is happening in `infra/dev` folder. Make sure to be in this folder:

```
cd infra/dev
```

```
make build
make up
```

Once this is completed you should have:

- front available on: http://localhost:3001
- hasura available on: http://localhost:8080
- server available on: http://localhost:3000/health
- postgres: available on http://localhost:5432 that should contain `twenty` database

### Step 3: IDE setup

If you are using VSCode, please use the `Dev Containers` extension to open the project in a container. This will allow you to run Visual Studio on top of the docker container. This will allow you to run the project without having to install node on your machine.

### Note

If you are using Docker install, make sure to ssh in the docker container during development to execute commands. You can also use `Makefile` to help you

## Development workflow

### Front tests

Run tests: `make front-test`
Run coverage: `make front-coverage`
Run storybook: `make front-storybook`

### Hasura development

Open hasura console: `make hasura-console`
Do your changes in hasura console on http://localhost:9695
Commit your changes in git
