# Workflows

The following steps assume that you have installed and configure the project with Docker.

## IDE Setup

If you are using VSCode, please use the `Dev Containers` extension to open the project in a container. This will allow you to run Visual Studio on top of the docker container. This will allow you to run the project without having to install node on your machine.

## Front tests

Run tests: `make front-test`
Run coverage: `make front-coverage`
Run storybook: `make front-storybook`

## Note

If you are using Docker install, make sure to ssh in the docker container during development to execute commands. You can also use `Makefile` to help you
