# Self-hosting

Right now, docker containers are the only option we currently support. However we are actively working on providing simple options to self host Twenty yourself. 
Feel free to open issues on [Github](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty) if you want a specific cloud provider to be supported.

Refer to this list to see what future options will be available

## Production docker containers

We provide a production-ready set of `Dockerfile` to allow you to build your own image and deploy it to your favorite cloud provider (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, ...)

You will find these in [infra/prod/front/Dockerfile](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/blob/main/infra/prod/front/Dockerfile) and [infra/prod/server/Dockerfile](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/blob/main/infra/prod/server/Dockerfile) files.

### Front

```
docker build \
 --build-arg REACT_APP_API_URL=REPLACE_ME \
 --build-arg REACT_APP_AUTH_URL=REPLACE_ME \
 --build-arg REACT_APP_FILES_URL=REPLACE_ME \
 -t twenty-front:latest \
 -f ./infra/prod/front/Dockerfile .
```

### Server

```
docker build \
  -t twenty-server:latest \
  -f ./infra/prod/server/Dockerfile .
```

To run the server, you will need to set a few environment variables you can find [here](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/blob/main/server/.env.example).

## Ready-to-deploy joint image (soon)

We are working on providing a joint docker image containing Twenty front and server, that you can deploy to Amazon Web Services (Elastic Beanstalk).

## Railway (soon)

[Railway](https://railway.app) is an infrastructure platform that let you deploy to the cloud in one-click. We are currently working on making it available.
