# Introduction

Twenty is an Open Source CRM.
<ThemedImage sources={{light: "./img/light-doc-preview.png", dark:"./img/dark-doc-preview.png"}} style={{width:'100%', maxWidth:'800px'}}/>


## Why did we create Twenty?
At first, CRM platforms were just for sales teams.
But now, they've grown to cover more than just sales - they handle many aspects of running a business.
This has often left in-house engineering teams out of the loop, making companies rely more on outside help to manage their CRM needs.

Our team has a shared passion for crafting beautiful products with great attention to details.
And we are starting this project with one key goal: to put the power back in the hands of the people who use CRM systems every day.
We wish to create a tool that users will enjoy, and that engineers will want to make their own and customize for their company's specific needs.

## Getting started

There are three ways for you to get started with Twenty:
- **Cloud:** the fastest and easiest way to try the app (it's free)
- **Local:** if you're a developer and would like to experiment or contribute to the app
- **Self-hosting:** if you want greater control over your data and want to run the app on your own server

See our [Getting Started](./start/getting-started/) guide to learn more.

## Contributing
Contributions are what makes the open source community such an amazing place.  
Code contributions through pull request are most welcome.
But it doesn't have to be code. You can also create an issue to report a bug you've spotted, join discussions or write documentation.
