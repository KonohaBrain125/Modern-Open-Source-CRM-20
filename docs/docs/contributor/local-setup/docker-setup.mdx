This guide will walk you through provisioning the project with Docker. This comes with a few advantages:
- It provides the exact same environment as our core developer team.
- It includes some additional dependencies (such as `playwright`) that you might need if you wish to contribute to some advanced areas of the project.
- It provisions a PostgreSQL database.

:::info
We do not recommend setting up the project with Docker if you are a Windows (WSL) user, unless you have experience with it, as it will make troubleshooting harder.
If you are a Windows user, we recommend using the [yarn installation](/contributor/local-setup/yarn-setup).
:::

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) versions installed on your computer.

You can run `docker --version` to verify the installation.

## Step 1: Git Clone

In your terminal, run the following command. 

We recommend using SSH for this step. If you already haven't set up SSH keys, please do so first. You can learn more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh). 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH (Recommended)" default>

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="https" label="HTTPS" >

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Setup env variables

Twenty requires a few environment variables to be set. Locally, we recommend setting them through `.env` files.

```bash
cd twenty
cp ./front/.env.example ./front/.env
cp ./server/.env.example ./server/.env 
```

The default values should work out of the box, except for the postgres URL, which requires a small modification.

Open `./server/.env` and change to the following:

```bash
PG_DATABASE_URL=postgres://twenty:twenty@postgres:5432/default?connection_limit=1
```


## Step 3: Build

We provide an environment containerized with Docker and orchestrated with `docker-compose`.
This installation method will also provision a PostgreSQL container.

:::info

The configuration for the build is stored in the `infra/dev` folder, but you can run `make` commands directly from the root folder.

:::

```bash
make build
```

## Step 4: Migrate & seed

Before running the project, you need to initialize the database by running the migrations and seed.

Start the containers:
```bash
make up
```

Run database migrations, generate prisma client, and seed:
```bash
make server-database-setup
make server-database-reset
```

## Step 5: Start Twenty

Run the project with the following commands from the `root` folder:

```bash
make server-start
```

```bash
make front-start
```

You should now have:
- **Frontend** available on: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- **Server** available on: [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)
- **Postgres** available on [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432) and containing database named `default`

Sign in using our seeded demo account `tim@apple.dev` (password: `Applecar2025`) to start using Twenty.

### Optional

If you don't want to use the `make` command and work directly from the container, you can also ssh directly into the container:

```bash
make sh
```
Then run commands through yarn:
```bash
cd server
yarn database:reset
```


### Troubleshooting

#### Docker throws errors while setting up local environment

If by any chance you run into problems with Docker, you should change the `docker-compose` to `docker compose` in `./infra/dev/Makefile` as `docker-compose` is an old version
that's becoming slowly obsolete. (More info can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/))
