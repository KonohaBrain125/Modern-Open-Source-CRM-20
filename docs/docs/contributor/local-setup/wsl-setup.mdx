This document guides you through installing the project with WSL2.

## Install WSL

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

You should be prompted to restart your computer. If not, restart it manually.

Upon restart, a powershell window will open and install Ubuntu. This may take a few minutes.
You will be prompted to create a username and password for your Ubuntu installation.

## Setup your developer environment

### Step #1: Install Git

```
sudo apt-get install git
```
Then, configure your git user name and email using the following commands, replacing name and email with your own. These details will be associated with any commits that you create:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```
:::note

If you don't have a Github account, create one now with the corresponding email address. We recommend that you setup a SSH key for your Github account. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/fr/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

### Step #2: Install Node.js, nvm, Yarn

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm. 

### Step #3: Install Twenty

Follow our [Yarn install guide](/contributor/local-setup/yarn-setup) to install Twenty.
We don't recommend using Docker on WSL as it adds an extra layer of complexity.
