Install WSL. Follow https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

## Setup your developer environment

### Install Git

Follow: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git

```
sudo apt-get install git
```
Then, configure your git user name and email using the following commands, replacing name and email with your own. These details will be associated with any commits that you create:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```

**Note:$$ If you don't have a Github account, create one now with the corresponding email address. We recommend that you setup a SSH key for your Github account. Follow the instructions here: https://docs.github.com/fr/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

### Install Node.js, nvm, Yarn

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm or run the following to use it now:

### Install Twenty project

You are ready to install Twenty project. Follow the [Yarn install guide](/contributor/local-setup#yarn-install-recommended) instructions.
We don't recommend to use Docker on WSL as it adds an extra layer of complexity.
