## Architecture

### Routing

We use [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing. 

To avoid unnecessary [re-renders](/contributor/frontend/advanced/best-practices#managing-re-renders) we handle all the routing logic in a `useEffect` in `PageChangeEffect`.

### State Management

We use [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts) for state management.

See our [best practices](/contributor/frontend/advanced/best-practices#state-management) for more managing state.

## Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for component testing.

Jest is mainly used for testing utility functions, and not components themselves.

Storybook is used for testing the behavior of isolated components, as well as displaying our [design system](/contributor/frontend/basics/design-system).
