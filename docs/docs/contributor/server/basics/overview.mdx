We primarily use NestJS for our backend. We previously used to have Prisma as the ORM with a lot of auto-generated code under the hood. But since we want to offer flexibility so that users can create custom fields and custom objects, we needed something more low-level than Prisma to have more fine-grained control. This is why we switched to TypeORM. Here's what our tech stack now looks like.
