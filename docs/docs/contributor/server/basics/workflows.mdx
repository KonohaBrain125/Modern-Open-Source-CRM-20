## First time setup

```
cd server
yarn # install dependencies

yarn prisma:migrate # run migrations
yarn prisma:generate # generate prisma and nestjs-graphql schemas
yarn prisma:seed # provision database with seeds

# alternatively, you can run
yarn prisma:reset # all-in-one command to reset, migrate, seed and generate schemas
```

## Starting a new feature

Make sure your database is running on the URL provided in your `server/.env` file.

```
cd server
yarn
yarn prisma:migrate && yarn prisma:generate

yarn start:dev
```

## Lint

```
yarn lint
```

## Test

```
yarn test
```

## Resetting the database

If you want to reset the database, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd server
yarn database:reset
```

This will drop the database and re-run the migrations and seed.

Make sure to back up any data you want to keep before running this command.
