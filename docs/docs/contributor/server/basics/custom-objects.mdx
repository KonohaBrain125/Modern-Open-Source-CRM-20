To elevate our platform experience and adhere to our dedication towards versatility, we've successfully integrated custom objects (objects available only in a specific workspace). 
Users across different workspaces can now seamlessly access custom objects using a dynamic GraphQL schema.

## How it works

Custom objects trace their roots back to metadata tables that dictate the shape, name, and type of the objects. All this information is housed in the metadata schema database, consisting of tables:

- **DataSource**: Details where data is stored.
- **Object**: Describes the object and is linked to a DataSource.
- **Field**: Outlines an Object's fields and connects to the Object.
