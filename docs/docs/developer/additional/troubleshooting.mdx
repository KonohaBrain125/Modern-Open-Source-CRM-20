# Troubleshooting


## Windows setup eslint prettier error: `CR` line breaks found

This is due to the linebreak characters of windows and the git configuration. Try running:
```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Then delete the repository and clone it again.


## Yarn lock file changed and new files are created (`yarn.lock`, `.yarnrc.yml`, `.yarn`)

Maybe you are using yarn 3? Try installing [yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)!
