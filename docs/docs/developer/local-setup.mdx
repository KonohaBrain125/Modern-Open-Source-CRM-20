Twenty is designed to be developer-friendly, and your local installation should be up and running in a few minutes.

In a nutshell:
- We recommend using `yarn` installation but we also provide an easy way to run the project with Docker.
- Twenty uses PostgreSQL as a database. If you don't have a PostgreSQL instance available, we also provide a one-line command to provision one through Docker.

The repository is structured as follows:
```
twenty
└───docs // contains this documentation
└───front // contains the frontend code for the application
└───server // contains the backend code for the application
└───infra // contains docker configurations for development and production deployments
```
___

# Recommended: Yarn Installation

**Note:** `npm` currently does not support local packages satisfactorily. We strongly recommend using `yarn` instead.

## Prerequisites

Before you can install and use Twenty, make sure you install the following on your computer:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Step #1: Git Clone

In your terminal, run the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```


## Step #2: Set up PostgreSQL Database
You need to have a PostgreSQL database available to be able to use Twenty. If you already have one available, you can skip this step.

If you don't, you can provision one through `docker` using the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

```bash
  cd twenty
  make provision-postgres
```

This will create a Docker container, exposing a PostgresSQL instance at [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432).

This instance contains two databases: `default` and `test`
You can access them using `twenty` postgres user (password: `twenty`)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux-wsl" label="Linux / Windows WSL">

To install PostgresSQL on WSL2, use the following commands:

```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Start postgresql service and connect to the database using default `postgres` user:

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Create two databases:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE "default";
CREATE DATABASE "test";
```

Create a user `twenty` with password `twenty`:

```sql
CREATE USER twenty PASSWORD 'twenty';
ALTER USER twenty CREATEDB;
```

Create `metadata` schema:
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "metadata";
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA metadata TO twenty;
```

Activate `uuid-ossp` extension: 
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step #3: Setup env variables

Twenty requires a few environment variables to be set. Locally, we recommend setting them through a `.env` file.

To do so, make copies of the `.env.example` files in `/front` and `/server`:
```bash
cp ./front/.env.example ./front/.env
cp ./server/.env.example ./server/.env
```

## Step #4: Server setup

**Note:** We recommend that you use `nvm` to install the correct `node` version. We have added a `server/.nvmrc` to ensure all contributors are using the same version.

To build Twenty server and seed some data into your database, run the following commands:
```bash
cd server
nvm install #recommended
nvm use #recommended 
yarn
yarn prisma:reset
yarn start:dev
```

Twenty's server will be up and running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Step #5: Frontend setup

**Note:** For the frontend setup, too, we recommend using `nvm` to install the right node version. 
To set up the frontend, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd ../front
nvm install #recommended
nvm use #recommended 
yarn
yarn start
```

Twenty's frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). Simply login using our seeded demo account: `tim@apple.dev` to start using Twenty.

# Docker Installation

You can also provision the project with Docker. This comes with a few advantages:
- It provides the exact same environment as our core developer team.
- It includes some additional dependencies (such as `playwright`) that you might need if you wish to contribute to some advanced areas of the project.
- It provisions a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest `Docker` and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) versions installed on your computer.

You can run `docker --version` to verify the installation.

## Step #1: Git Clone
In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```

## Step #2: Setup env variables

Twenty requires a few environment variables to be set. Locally, we recommend setting them through `.env` files.

```bash
cp ./front/.env.example ./front/.env
cp ./server/.env.example ./server/.env 
```

The default values should work out of the box, except for the postgres URL, which requires a small modification.

Open `./server/.env` and change to the following:

```bash
PG_DATABASE_URL=postgres://twenty:twenty@postgres:5432/default?connection_limit=1
```


## Step #3: Build

We provide an environment containerized with Docker and orchestrated with `docker-compose`.
This installation method will also provision a PostgreSQL container.

**Note:** The configuration for the build is stored in the `infra/dev` folder, but you can run `make` commands directly from the root folder.

```bash
make build
```

## Step #4: Migrate & seed

Before running the project, you need to initialize the database by running the migrations and seed.

Start the containers:
```bash
make up
```

Run database migrations, generate prisma client, and seed:
```bash
make server-prisma-reset
```

## Step #5: Start Twenty

Run the project with the following commands from the `root folder`:

```bash
make server-start
```

```bash
make front-start
```

You should now have:
- **Frontend** available on: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- **Server** available on: [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)
- **Postgres** available on [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432) and containing database named `default`

Sign in using our seeded demo account `tim@apple.dev` (password: `Applecar2025`) to start using Twenty

### Optional

If you don't want to use the `make` command and work directly from the container, you can also ssh directly into the container:

```bash
make sh
```
Then run commands through yarn:
```bash
cd server
yarn prisma:reset
```
