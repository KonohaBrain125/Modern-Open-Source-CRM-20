Use our [in-browser GraphiQL app](https://docs.twenty.com/graphql/) to browse, query, and mutate our introspection query. 

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that enables declarative data fetching that allows a client to specify exactly what data it needs from the API.

Instead of exposing various endpoints that return fixed data strcutures, GraphQL exposes only a single endpoint that precisely returns the data that the client asked for. This makes GraphQL more flexible and efficient than other kinds of APIs, like REST APIs. 

To learn more about GraphQL, we recommend going through this [Introduction](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/).

## About GraphQL Introspection

GraphQL query language is strongly typed, which makes it possible for you to query and understand the underlying schema. 

With the Introspection feature, you can query the schema and discover the queries (to request data), mutations (to modify data), types, and fields available in a particular GraphQL API.

## Try Our GraphQL Playground
Use our browser-based, interactive [GraphQL playground](https://docs.twenty.com/graphql/) to run mutations and queries to discover valid fields and where you can use them.
