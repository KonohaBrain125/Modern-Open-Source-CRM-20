# Workflows

The following steps assume that you have installed and configure the project with Docker.

## IDE Setup

If you are using VSCode, please use the `Dev Containers` extension to open the project in a container.
This will allow you to run Visual Studio on top of the docker container.

## Front tests

Run tests: `make front-test`  
Run tests with coverage: `make front-coverage`

## Running commands
If you are using Docker install, make sure to ssh in the docker container during development to execute commands.
You can use `Makefile` to help you do this: `make sh` will open a CLI in the docker container and commands such as `make front-test` have been setup to be executed in the container.
