# Quickstart
You can access and use the alpha version on [app.twenty.com](https://app.twenty.com).  
Soon, we will release click-to-deploy buttons for Render and Railway.

For a local setup, please check [the documentation](https://docs.twenty.com/developer/local-setup).  
It's a straightforward process that should have you up and running in minutes.

# About
We are building an Open Source CRM designed to be: enjoyable to use, easily extendable, and perfectly in-sync with your data. 

Twenty was created as a Public Benefits Company. This means we're legally bound to consider the impact of our decisions not just on shareholders, but also on society.
Our belief is simple: great companies focus on helping people and meeting their users' needs above all. The decision to go open source was therefore a natural one for us. It fits with our aim to do what's right and with our goals for the business:

**For our users:**
- A commitment to being completely open about what we're building, enabling them to peek under the hood and see the intricate machinery at work.
- An opportunity to be a decisive actor with a very short feedback loop and an the ability to shape the roadmap
  
**For the developer community:**
- A CRM that ban self-hosted for free, on your own network and close to your data sources
- A set of reusuable components such as tables or kanban boards (coming soon)
- A new way to think about CRM extensibility, one that can be owned by the engineering team and not external constultants (coming soon)
