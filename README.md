# About
Twenty is an Open Source CRM designed to be:
- Easily extendable
- Perfectly in-sync with your data
- Crafted with care and enjoyable to use

# Helping us
- The easiest way to help us is to star the repo and helping us getting visibility
- Contributions are, of course, most welcome! It doesn't have to be code, you could also create an issue to report a bug you've spotted, join discussions or write documentation.

# Quickstart
Soon, you should be able to try a demo directly on [app.twenty.com](https://app.twenty.com), our cloud offering with a generous free tier. We'll also release click-to-deploy buttons for Render and Railway.

In the meantime, you can check [the documentation](https://docs.twenty.com/start/local-setup). It shouldn't take more than a few minutes to install locally.

# Documentation
The doc is available on [docs.twenty.com](https://docs.twenty.com)

We don't have a Slack community yet but we will create one when we are ready to launch.
In the meantime, feel free to create a Github issue or open a discussion.
