# Quickstart
Access the alpha version at [app.twenty.com](https://app.twenty.com). Click-to-deploy buttons for Render and Railway are coming soon.

For local setup, refer to [the documentation](https://docs.twenty.com/developer/local-setup). Expect a quick and easy startup.

# About
We are building an Open Source CRM designed to be: enjoyable to use, easily extendable, and perfectly in-sync with your data. 

Twenty was created as a Public Benefits Company. This means we're legally bound to consider the impact of our decisions not just on shareholders, but also on society.

Our belief is simple: **great companies focus on helping people** and meeting their users' needs above all. The decision to go open source was therefore a natural one for us. It fits with our aim to do what's right and with our goals for the business:

**For our users:**
- We are committed to complete transparency regarding what we are building, allowing you to take a look inside and observe the intricate machinery in action.
- This enables you to be a decisive actor of the roadmap by contributing or building your own tool.
  
**For the developer community:**
- We offer a self-hosted CRM solution that you can use for free, keeping your data on your own servers.
- We are developing a collection of reusable components, such as tables or kanban boards (coming soon).
- We are introducing a new approach to CRM extensibility, one that can be managed by your engineering team instead of relying on external consultants (coming soon).
